			<p><span epub:type="z3998:salutation">My beloved <span epub:type="z3998:recipient">Barbara Alexievna</span></span>⁠—I hasten to let you know that Rataziaev has found me some work to do for a certain writer⁠—the latter having submitted to him a large manuscript. Glory be to God, for this means a large amount of work to do. Yet, though the copy is wanted in haste, the original is so carelessly written that I hardly know how to set about my task. Indeed, certain parts of the manuscript are almost undecipherable. I have agreed to do the work for forty kopecks a sheet. You see therefore (and this is my true reason for writing to you), that we shall soon be receiving money from an extraneous source. Goodbye now, as I must begin upon my labours.⁠—<span epub:type="z3998:valediction">Your sincere friend,</span></p>
