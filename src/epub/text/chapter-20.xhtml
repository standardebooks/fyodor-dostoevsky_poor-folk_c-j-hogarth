			<p><span epub:type="z3998:salutation">My dearest <span epub:type="z3998:recipient">Makar Alexievitch</span></span>⁠—Today Thedora came to me with fifteen roubles in silver. How glad was the poor woman when I gave her three of them! I am writing to you in great haste, for I am busy cutting out a waistcoat to send to you⁠—buff, with a pattern of flowers. Also I am sending you a book of stories; some of which I have read myself, particularly one called “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.short-story">The Cloak</span>.”⁠ ⁠… You invite me to go to the theatre with you. But will it not cost too much? Of course we might sit in the gallery. It is a long time (indeed I cannot remember when I last did so) since I visited a theatre! Yet I cannot help fearing that such an amusement is beyond our means. Thedora keeps nodding her head, and saying that you have taken to living above your income. I myself divine the same thing by the amount which you have spent upon me. Take care, dear friend, that misfortune does not come of it, for Thedora has also informed me of certain rumours concerning your inability to meet your landlady’s bills. In fact, I am very anxious about you. Now, goodbye, for I must hasten away to see about another matter⁠—about the changing of the ribands on my bonnet.</p>
