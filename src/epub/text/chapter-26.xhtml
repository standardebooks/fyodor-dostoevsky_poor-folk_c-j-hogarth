			<p><span epub:type="z3998:salutation">My dearest <span epub:type="z3998:recipient">Makar Alexievitch</span></span>⁠—I have read your two letters, and they make my heart ache. See here, dear friend of mine. You pass over certain things in silence, and write about a <em>portion</em> only of your misfortunes. Can it be that the letters are the outcome of a mental disorder? … Come and see me, for God’s sake. Come today, direct from the office, and dine with us as you have done before. As to how you are living now, or as to what settlement you have made with your landlady, I know not, for you write nothing concerning those two points, and seem purposely to have left them unmentioned. Au revoir, my friend. Come to me today without fail. You would do better <em>always</em> to dine here. Thedora is an excellent cook. Goodbye⁠—<span epub:type="z3998:valediction">Your own,</span></p>
